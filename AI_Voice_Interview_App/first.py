            "ideal": "Use `let` for block-scoped variables that can be reassigned, `const` for block-scoped constants that cannot be reassigned, and avoid `var` as it's function-scoped with hoisting behavior that can lead to unexpected results."

            "question": "What is the virtual DOM?",
            "ideal": "The virtual DOM is a JavaScript representation of the real DOM kept in memory. React uses it to optimize rendering by comparing the current virtual DOM with the previous version (diffing) and only updating the parts of the real DOM that have actually changed."
